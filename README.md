# Python based Invertible-PRNG

Python based invertible multi-precision pseudo random number generator inspired by the website https://babelia.libraryofbabel.info/

Decided to try and make it in python as it doesnt have a max int value. The code is a bit lacking.
I want to make it so you could change the number of bits used for color, the size of the image and enable transparency and the code to adapt and calculate a new PRNG that would be invertible. 

If you want to contact me you can do so at karlo.mohenski@gmail.com
